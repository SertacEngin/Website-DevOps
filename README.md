# Website-DevOps
Automating a website's build, test, and deployment process

Project Overview

    Objective: Create a simple static website, containerize it with Docker, automate testing and deployment using CI/CD pipelines, and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster.
    Tools:
        Docker: Containerize the website.
        Kubernetes: Orchestrate container deployment (using Minikube for local development).
        GitHub Actions: Primary CI/CD tool for building, testing, and deploying (alternative to Jenkins for simplicity and GitHub integration).
        Jenkins (optional): Can be added for a traditional CI/CD setup.
        Terraform (optional): Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision cloud resources.
        Ansible (optional): Configuration management for server setup.
        Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring the Kubernetes cluster (optional for extra credit).
